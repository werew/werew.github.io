Hey there! I'm Luigi (aka werew), your friendly neighborhood security engineer. With ~5 years of real-world experience, including a stint at Meta (where I defended your cat memes and vacation photos). 

- **All things CS:** I eat, sleep, and breathe computer science. From algorithms that make your head spin to those that make you laugh, I've got you covered.

- **Living the depths:** I've delved into the depths of cybersecurity and emerged with tales of code, chaos and corruption.

- **Problem solving:** Whether it's protecting your data or figuring out how to untangle my headphones (an unsolved mystery), I love cracking puzzles.

So, if you're into security and code stick around ;)
