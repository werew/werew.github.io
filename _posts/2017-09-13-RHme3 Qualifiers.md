Some time ago RHme3 qualifiers were ending. The challenges 
were very interesting to do and some of them particularly frustrating
(yes whitebox crypto, I'm talking about you). 

Luckily I was able to solve them all but unfortunately I never had the time 
to write a proper writeup for all of them.
Therefore I decided to upload my solution together with the actual challenges on github.
They can be found [here](https://github.com/werew/CTFs/tree/master/RHME3_quals).
